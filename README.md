# Actualize Yourself, a task-mangement website

## Introduction

Unlike other task managers, Actualize Yourself is focused on the person, the process of improving, and long-term goals.


## Installation

If you want to use our site as a boilerplate,

1. Create a mysql database called `tasksDB`

2. Update the `config.json` to match your local database, username, password

3. Add a `.env` at the top level of this project. 

4. Then inside of the .env add a SERVER_SECRET set to any value you'd like
```
SERVER_SECRET = 123456
```

5. `npm install`

6. `node server.js`
